\[
  (W, \sqsubseteq) - \text{preorder}
\]

\[
  \sigma \colon \Var \to W \to \{\mathsf{T}, \mathsf{F}\}
\]

Valuation $\sigma$ should be monotonic.

\begin{alignat*}{2}
  \sigma, w \models p & \iff \sigma(p)(w) = \mathsf{T} \\
  \sigma, w \models \varphi \wedge \psi & \iff
    \sigma, w \models \varphi \text{ and }\sigma, w \models \psi \\
  \sigma, w \models \top & \iff \text{always} \\
  \sigma, w \models \bot & \iff \text{never} \\
  \sigma, w \models \varphi \longrightarrow \psi & \iff
    \forall w'\sqsupseteq w \ldotp
      \sigma, w' \models \varphi \implies \sigma, w' \models \psi \\
\end{alignat*}

\[
  (W, \sqsubseteq, \Index{\cdot})
\]

\[
  \Index{\cdot}\colon W \to \mathbb N
\]

$\Index{\cdot}$ should be monotonic, meaning
$\forall w \sqsupseteq w'\ldotp  \Index{w} \leq \Index{w'}$.

\[
  \varphi \Coloneqq \cdots \mid \Later \varphi
\]

\[
  \sigma, w \models \Later \varphi \iff
    \forall w' \sqsupseteq w\ldotp
      \Index{w'} + 1 \leq \Index{w} \implies \sigma, w' \models \varphi
\]
