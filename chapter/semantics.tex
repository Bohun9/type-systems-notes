\section{Further Reading}

As pointed out during the lecture, we've already seen one-hole contexts
on the Functional Programming course
in the data structure called \emph{The Zipper}~\citep{Huet97}.
Interestingly, \citet{McBride} observed that one-hole contexts used
in the Zipper data structure can be derived automatically,
and such a derivation has a lot in common with
a symbolic derivative of a function.
