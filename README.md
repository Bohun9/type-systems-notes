Lecture Notes on Type Systems
=============================

This repository contains lecture notes for the Type Systems course given in
Institute of Computer Science, University of Wroc≈Çaw in Autumn 2023. The main
idea behind these notes is to write them together with the students. We invite
students attending the course to contribute to these notes. See
[Contribution Guideline](https://github.com/ppolesiuk/type-systems-notes/wiki/Contribution-Guideline)
for more details how to contribute to this project. You can also see our
[issue tracker](https://github.com/ppolesiuk/type-systems-notes/issues).
