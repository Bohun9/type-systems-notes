Syntax of types with unification variables:
$\tau \Coloneqq \tau \to \tau \mid \syncatset{Bool} \mid ?X$

Inference rules:

\newcommand\unify{\stackrel{?}{=}}

\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule{(x : \tau) \in \Gamma}
            {\Gamma\vdash x \Uparrow \tau / \emptyset}

  \inferrule{\Gamma, x : ?X \vdash e \Uparrow \tau_2 / \Theta}
            {\Gamma\vdash \lambda x.e \Uparrow \Theta^*(?X) \to \tau_2 / \Theta}

  \inferrule{\Gamma\vdash e_1 \Uparrow \tau_2 \to \tau_1 / \Theta_1 \\ \Gamma\vdash e_2 \Downarrow \tau_2 / \Theta_2}
            {\Gamma\vdash e_1\;e_2 \Uparrow \tau_1 / \Theta_2 \circ \Theta_1}

  \inferrule{\Gamma\vdash e_1 \Uparrow ?X / \Theta_1 \\ \Theta_1'^*\Gamma\vdash e_2 \Downarrow ?Y / \Theta_2}
            {\Gamma\vdash e_1\;e_2 \Uparrow \Theta_2^*(?Z) / \Theta_2 \circ \Theta_1'}

  \text{where }\Theta_1' = \Theta_1[?X \mapsto ?Y \to ?Z]

  \inferrule{\Gamma\vdash e \Uparrow \tau' / \Theta \\ \Theta^*\tau \unify \tau' / \Theta'}
            {\Gamma\vdash e \Downarrow \tau / \Theta' \circ \Theta}
\end{mathpar}

Type unification:

\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule{ }
            {\syncatset{Bool} \unify \syncatset{Bool} / \emptyset}

  \inferrule{\tau_1 \unify \tau_2 / \Theta_1 \\ \Theta_1^* \tau_2 \unify \Theta_1^* \tau_2'}
            {\tau_1 \to \tau_1' \unify \tau_2 \to \tau_2' / \Theta_2 \circ \Theta_1}

  \inferrule{ }
            {?X \unify ?X / \emptyset}

  \inferrule{?X \not\in \text{fuv}(\tau) }
            {?X \unify \tau / [?X \mapsto \tau]}

  \inferrule{?X \not\in \text{fuv}(\tau) }
            {\tau \unify ?X / [?X \mapsto \tau]}
\end{mathpar}
